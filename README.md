# Salary Negotiation App - VueJs

## Getting started

- Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies with

  ```
  yarn install
  ```

- I have included an API key that you can test the app with in the `.env.example` file (Ideally, I would share keys like this privately). Copy this value to a `.env` file in the root of the project before starting the app or creating a production bundle.

## Available scripts:

### Run the app locally

```
yarn serve
```

### Create a minified production build

```
yarn build
```

### Run unit tests

```
yarn test:unit
```

### Run end to end tests

```
yarn test:e2e
```
